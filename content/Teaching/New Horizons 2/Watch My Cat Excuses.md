## Game Details
- Split the students into groups of 4-6 students.
- A map of all Japanese prefectures will be displayed.
- Students will have 30 seconds to create a sentence using the template "I went to \_\_\_\_\_ to \_\_\_\_\_\_"
- After the time, one student from each group will read the sentences written.
	- "I went to **Hokkaido** to **eat miso ramen**."
	- "I went to **Aomori** to **buy apples**."
- Teams who answer different prefectures will each earn +1 point, while teams that answer the same will get no points.
- On any prefecture that a team earns points for, mark it off on the map. It is no longer able to be used in the game.
	- Note: when two teams answer for a single prefecture and get no points, the shared prefecture is not marked off the map and may be attempted again.
- Repeat rounds for as long as needed or until prefectures run out.

## Notes
- Use [this website](https://www.mapchart.net/japan.html) for the map. Enable prefecture names and zoom the page in until the map fills the screen (usually 150% zoom). You will need to scroll up and down, but most of the map will be visible, but putting your browser in full screen with help with this.
- You can expect to run through about 6 rounds in 20 minutes.
- Making the students write down their answers on a whiteboard, or at least a piece of paper will help prevent any last minute changes to answers before their turn comes around.
- I suggest writing down what each prefecture is for each group every round, to help keep track of repeat prefectures. Also have your JTE score; this activity can be a lot to keep track of.
