## Game Details
- All students will stand up.
- The ALT will stand at the front of the room with a printout of the cat and ask each student "Will you watch this cat for me?"
- Students will have to come up with an excuse "Sorry, I have to/I must..."; no repeating.
- If the student comes up with an excuse they may down and the next student will be asked. If they can not or answer with an excuse that has already been used, they will take the cat and continue asking the question themselves.
- The game continues until all students are seated.
## Notes
- This activity runs about 5 minutes short of half a period, this can be filled with an anecdote or time killing activity.
- I highly suggest bringing a sticker sheet to encouraging students to come up with funny or wild answers. I usually say if it's funny, creative or makes me laugh, the student gets a sticker.
