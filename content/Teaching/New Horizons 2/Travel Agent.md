## Notes

- When explaining the activity, I suggest writing "**Come to \_\_\_\_\_!**" to use as a starter, followed by the "You can enjoy" sentence.
- I suggest using a [random prefecture chooser](https://thuvien.org/random/japan_prefecture) to assign prefectures to groups.
	- Doing a drum roll when choosing a prefecture helps gets the students excited, using a visualized wheel spinning would probably be even better for choosing the prefecture.
- My first class I did this in the students were super enthusiastic, and all came up to the front of the room and did there presentations, but my following classes were more reserved. Trying to figure out how to recreate that. I'm thinking getting the JTE involved would be good.
- This activity is a bit difficult to judge the timing of. Presentations can be less than 10 minutes or over 20, depending on the enthusiasm and involvement of the students.
- As always stickers are a good way to incentivize participation.
- This activity was adapted from the [Travel Agents Use Gerunds](https://www.altopedia.net/activities/1058-travel-agents-use-gerunds) activity off of ALTopedia.
